# XAI-SmoothGrad-RISE
I hope you will enjoy my project as much as I did!
To run the jupyter notebook you will need these specific installations:
!pip install tensorflow
!pip install tf-keras-vis
!pip install tqdm
!pip install opencv-python
!pip install scikit-learn
!pip install pandas
It is also worth to note that the the jupyter notebook needs to be in the same directory as the image folder, to be able to run the code. The image folder is the same as in the last assignment, therefore if you just replace the NN notebook, with my notebook, the code should run without any problems. The notebook is segmented into multiple parts, loading the data, running SmoothGrad and RISE on small amount of data, and then implementing both algorithms on 15 images from the dataset and evaluating them.
